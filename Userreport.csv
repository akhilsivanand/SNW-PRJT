Here sum up of test we made with Pavan help today (thanks a lot Pavan for your support on this topic!):
1. Test connection on UAT Unix server from my AVC with Frederico user - test failed and error message was access denied
2. Test SAS connection from Frederico's Laptop with SSO option - test failed
3. Test SAS connection from Frederico's Laptop with my user - test failed with same error message than previous point
4. Test ping SAS meta data server from Frederico's Laptop - success
5. We wanted test if we could open a telnet session on meta data server, but tool was not present on Frederico's laptop

Error message for point 2 and 3 was not very precise and mentioned different reason. Nevertheless, it seems that connection from a SAS tool installed locally was not possible and end user has to use SAS from AVC session.

As in Italy AVC is not deployed until now, but only some test users use it, suggestion is that Frederico was part of AVC test users.

@Pavan, Frederico: feel free to correct/add information if any.

Best regards,

   Issue is possibly related to IPM-14714925. Investigation ongoing.
02.07.2019 16:45:48   uvph82f
   The WebEx troubleshooting session lasted this whole day. We were able to make it work on Win7 without any issues, though we were not able to do the same on Win10.

We have tested the older application version and it worked without any issues.

As agreed we will rollback the application to the older version and will continue to investigate the issue of 4262 within the UAT environment.

SAS team informed that they tested the rollback version, everything works as expected on both WIN7 and WIN10.
SAS team informed that certain files are not opening after the rollback.  
DXC informed that the package sequence has created the issue so new package request to be made by SAS team and same will be rolled out for the users. Initially for few users the new package will be implemented to check and further for all user new package will be implemented
Further troubleshooting will be done in backend and the ticket priority will be lowered to P3
