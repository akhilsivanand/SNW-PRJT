# Ticket Recommendation System

Faster incident resolution can be considered to be of at most importance from a service and customer perspective. The time taken for incident resolution will increase if
the tickets are assigned to wrong team 
if the ticket receiving team is not familiar with the said issue. 
The proposition is to implement a ticket recommendation system based on natural language processing(NLP).  The interactive ticket recommendation system will recommend the most relevant ticket details including the functional group and resolution. This makes the ticketing process simple, efficient and customer friendly.
